                There are many diffrent kinds of frauds, but all of them don't have good 
                intentions for the victims, most of the devievers want money or personal 
                information. So they act like they have good intentions, by saying 
                they themselves are a victim of something or by tricking some poor souls 
                into giving them money for some kind of deal. These deals are most 
                to good to be true like just giving away a few million dollars or other 
                currencies and real dangerous one are the ones that could seem 
                reasonable like a friendly charity, which sets sail to the some 
                tropical island after some time.
            </p>	

            <h3>Charity fraud</h3>
			<p>
                Like above descripted a Charity Fraud is made by a charity which decevies user of a website
                 or other service so they give some money to an alledged charity.
            </p>
            <p>
                These scamming charities are not to diffrent from the a bit less malicouses
                 charities which only put a percentage of the profit into their own bags.
                 While those are quite unmoral aswell they at least give most of the collected
                 money to the cause the user thought got their money.
            </p>

            <p>It is pretty hard to spot this kind of fraud, because they mostly
                seem like a real one. But if the charity you want to spend your money one does
                one of these things:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>no <em>regular updates</em> how the money is spent</li>
                <li>there aren't any indications about who the site owner is</li>
                <li>there isn't much information about the cause</li>
                <li>there have been incidents</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                You should probably <em>think about your actions twice</em>
                 because else your money might be the funds of the next
                 vacation of some guy pretending to be a charity
            </p>

            <h3>Gambling Fraud</h3>

            <p>

                Much like charity fraud this kind of scheme can be pretty hard
                to spot, because there is a chance that you loose your money
                when you are gambling even though you gamble on a pretty respected
                site.
            </p>

            <p>Some people might argue that every kind of gambling is some kind

                of fraud but we don't want to debate about this aspect. With
                this spirit we declare every kind of gambling where the
                participants <em>don't have any chance to win </em>something or even
                break even.
            </p>

            <p>to spot such a scheme your best option is to check their website

                for <em>inconsistencies </em>or other sketchy stuff. Other than that its
                again up to your gut to decide if you can trust the services.
                Of course number one rule is if an offer feels <em>too good</em> to be true
                it's probably not true and just some kind of <em>scheme</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>email shemes</h3>

            <p>

                Such shemes are probably already well known to most people
                already were in such an situation or heard storys from other
                people. For anybody who doesn't know the scheme thats described
                above here's a quick explaination. The suspect sends an emotonial
                e-mail to victims, which e-mail addresses they got from some database,
                in this e-mail the is some story like an relative died and
                to inherit their belongings you should pay a fee. It could
                also be that there is an offer where you pay a fee and get
                money somehow but it could also "escalate" into a charity frauds
                through a heart warming story about a cancer patient or anything
                else like that.
            </p>

            <p>

                Most of these scammers probably just want to get some easy bucks
                from you but some are also out for personal information or
                credit card details
            </p>

            <h3>Pyramid Scheme</h3>

            <p>
                A pyramid scheme is more like a really sketchy company that
                tries to communicate to people that they can make easy money
                just by paying a fee and than promoting thist "great" company
                with its unbelievable deals to get more people into signing in.
                A victim may actully get some kind of profit, but because the
                only thing the company does is hiring people for a fee and get
                them to sign even more people into this rabbit hole. So the only
                income is the fee everybody has to pay.
            </p>

            <p>

                As you may already thought the income the employees get are the
                fees of the victims below. Because of this model you always need
                to get more subjects into this mess to get money for the other
                poor souls who signed into this. The only person who makes a proper
                profit is the person who started the whole thing. Most of the time
                he will just get out of the company with all the earnings and
                the victims who probably didn't have much money before have just
                invested into one of the most unethical ways to make some cash.
            </p>

            <p>
                The legal situation about this scheme is quite weird, because if
                you get people invest their money into this scheme it's illegal,
                but if you get people to buy a product as the fee it's legal in most
                contries. This product is practicly something that can be produced
                or bought dirt cheap
            </p>
