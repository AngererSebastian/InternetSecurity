            <h3>What is cybersecurity</h3>
            cybersecurity is the practice to defend Computer, Server and mobile phones from
             malicious attacks. In the US the government spends yearly <em>13 billion dollars</em>
             on cybersecurity. The government recommends a live monitoring of all electronical
             devices.

            <h3>How can you Protect yourself?</h3>
            If you want to be save against any kind of malicious software I have to disappoint you,
             because there is no algorithm that can check for every kind of virus or malware. But
             there are ways that can improve your security. If you want to be secure so that no other
             party can read your emails or text messages, you should encrypt them. You can also buy
             a <em>security software</em> which does this kinds of things, and much more. If the software
             finds a part of sketchy looking code it will isolate it and remove it.

            <h3>Fraud Protection</h3>
            Let’s start with your Social Security number. It’s an important part of your identity,
             and you want to protect it in every way you can. For instance, remember to never save
             it ont your PC. It’s too easy to get stolen. That information would give a thief what
             he might need to steal your identity. Remember you should always keep in mind that
             there could be a hacker who searches through your data only to collect these kinds of
             things. <br>
            If you browse through the internet and see some kind of sketchy looking pages always
             double check before you click on them.
            <dl>
                <dt><h4>Here are some ways to recognize a fraud website: </h4></dt>
                <br>
                <dd>
                    Try not to enter personal information on websites with <em>http://.</em>
                     because the encryption type is outdated.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dd>
                    Usually the browser it self tells you if a certain website is 
                     secure or not. It will be highlighted with red when it is not
                     secure and green when it is. Keep in mind that https:// does
                     not mean that it is 100% secure.

                    A favorite trick of scammers is to create websites with addresses that mimic
                     those of large brands or companies, like <em>Yah00.com</em> or <em>Amaz0n.net</em>. Scammers
                     count on you skimming over the address and domain name, so it’s always worth
                     double-checking the address bar if you’re redirected to a website from another page.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dd>
                    One of the simplest ways but also one of the most effective is to look out for
                     poor grammar and spelling. You can also look out for some random patterns like
                     every word is capitalized. If that is the case, you should double check.

                    If you think you have found the bargain of the century, I would be extremely cautious and
                     make a test if it is real.

            <h3>Security Software</h3>
            Computer security software or cybersecurity software is any computer program designed to
             enhance information security. There are various kinds of it, but the probably most important
             is the anti virus software.
             <br><br>
            <h4>How does it work</h4>
            It analyses all of your files and searches for signature files. These signature files contains
             a part of code which is common for that kind of virus. If it finds one which is almost similar
             to this signature code the data will be isolated and deleted or set in quarantine. Anti malware
             software is almost similar to the anti virus software but it needs a lot more updates then the
             antivirus software.
