			<h3>Setup to use the App</h3>

			<p>
				To use this webapp you need to setup our custom webserver.
				The source files can be found on our
				<a href="https://github.com/AngererSebastian/InternetSecurity">github</a>
				under the folder httpServer. The server is written in go and can be compiled
				with a normal <em>go-compiler</em>(
				<a href="golang.org">go</a> for windows, mac and linux,
				<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">gcc-go</a> with binaries for linux)
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					You need to get a copy of our source code. You can clone
					clone the repo with <em>git clone</em> or just download
					the zip file. We won't be realesing any binaries, so you 
					need to compile it youself.
				</li>

				<li>
					Next you need to compile the server. If you decided to download
					the standart go compiler you just need to run <em>go build</em>
					inside the desired directory and the program should be compiled
					after a while. For the gcc option you will need to dig into the
					documentation. We may make a makefile for easier use in the future
				</li>

				<li>
					The rest should be straight forward, you just need to run
					./httpServer &lt;port&gt; (.\ for windows). If you want to run
					this program from anywhere (for whatever reason) you could put
					it inside you PATH variable. But we don't recommend this.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Further Reading</h3>
			<p>
				We don't recommend to run this server on a public lan
				or in any lan where you don't trust everybody. The service
				is also not meant as an secure messaging plattform. It
				should be used for educational purposes only. You shoudn't
				send any sensitive data over it.
