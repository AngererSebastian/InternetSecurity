            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
                This part of the web page will show how to not be <em>fooled</em> into
                some kind of malware or scheme. It accomplishes that through telling
                you what to look out for and well it also will talk about
                that you shouldn't trust anyone unless they have proven themselves
                trustworthy. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Common Sense</h3>

            <p>
                The first thing to avoid getting into frauds is to use <em>common sense</em>.
                For example if somebody wants to give you money just out of the kind
                of their heart it is probably not trustworthy and you should just
                move along. A goood way of thinking in these kind of situation is
                what the other person <em>could get from you</em>. It could be anything from
                <em>public reputation</em> to some kind of income on their behalf.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another thing that falls other common sense is to be skeptical
                of strangers. And even if a suppossed famous person is making
                an offer to you think about the situation <em>rationally</em> and never
				truly believe them until the have proven that they aren't some 
				kind of pretender.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">

            <h3>Searching</h3>
            
            <p>
                If for example an unknown company makes you an offer, you should
                probably feel like you have been approached by a stranger on the
                street that has made you an unbelievable offer. Just because there
                isn't just one shady person behind doesn't mean you are safe.
                So you should <em>search up the company's history</em>(on their website, and 
                other sources as well) if there are any <em>contradicting</em> facts
                it's probably safest to decline the offer. Even if there
                is a well known and trustworthy company behind. Check if
                their <em>e-mail addresses, domain names</em>,... match up with
                the originals on the company's website. This could also
                that the pretending website uses an old theme of the original
                or other small details which don't make sense.
            </p>

            <p>
                To check if some company is trustworthy you can also try
                to <em>ask the employees details</em> about their company and the
                supposed location(more useful if you live in the area)
                this can be easiest accomplished during an tech support
                or e-mail scheme, because you are in direct contact with
                the employees and the company probably doesn't really
                operate under the described condition, unlike a pyramid
                scheme where the company really exists, but the fact
                that you probably won't get any money from this isn't said.

            <h3>Think about it</h3>

            <p>
                This the part where you gathered all important information and
                just need to <em>think about the whole situation</em> this is the most tricky
                part of the whole process because just need to think about what you found
                if it is important. If you found anything of significant value or situation
                wasn't important to you at all it's pretty easy to get to an opinion, but
                if you didn't find any strong evidence and liked the offer or whatever
                it is pretty hard to get to the point. You could try to sleep
                over it, if you can't find one valid opinion. Then the best
                option should be clear, at least we hope so.
                But as you already noticed it comes all down to your own gut to decide
                if something is malicious or not.
