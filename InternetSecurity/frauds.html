			<h3>Summary</h3>
			
			<p>
                There are many different kinds of frauds, but all of them don't have good 
                intentions for the victims, most of the deceivers want <em>money or personal
                information</em>. So they <em>act</em> like they have good intentions, by saying 
                they themselves are a victim of something or by tricking some poor souls 
                into giving them money for some kind of deal. These deals are most 
                to <em>good to be true</em> like just giving away a few million dollars or other 
                currencies and real dangerous one are the ones that could seem 
                reasonable like a friendly charity, which sets sail to the some 
                tropical island after some time.
            </p>

            <h3>Charity fraud</h3>
			<p>
                Like above descripted a Charity Fraud is made by a charity which <em>deceives</em> user of a website
                 or other service so they give some money to an supposed charity.
            </p>
            <p>
                These scamming charities are not to different from the a bit less malicious
                 charities which only put a percentage of the profit into their own bags.
                 While those are quite unmoral as well they at least give most of the collected
                 money to the cause the user thought got their money.
            </p>

            <p>It is pretty hard to spot this kind of fraud, because they mostly
                seem like a real one. But if the charity you want to spend your money one does
                one of these things:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>no <em>regular updates</em> how the money is spent</li>
                <li>there aren't any indications about who the site owner is</li>
                <li>there isn't much information about the cause</li>
                <li>there have been incidents</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                You should probably <em>think about your actions twice</em>
                 because else your money might be the funds of the next
                 vacation of some guy pretending to be a charity
            </p>

            <h3>Gambling Fraud</h3>

            <p>
                Much like charity fraud this kind of scheme can be pretty hard
                to spot, because there is a chance that you loose your money
                when you are gambling even though you gamble on a pretty respected
                site.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some people might argue that every kind of gambling is some kind
                of fraud but we don't want to debate about this topic. With
                this spirit we declare every kind of gambling where the
                participants <em>don't have any chance to win </em>something or even
                break even a fraud.
            </p>

            <p>
                The operators of the casino can trick people to get money
                through <em>rigging</em> the game or getting <em>other associated 
                people to encourage them to bet more</em> or just straight up
                don't give them any chance of winning.
            </p>

            <p>
                to spot such a scheme your best option is to check their website
                for <em>inconsistencies </em>or other sketchy stuff. Other than that its
                again up to your gut to decide if you can trust the services.
                Of course number one rule is if an offer feels <em>too good</em> to be true
                it's probably not true and just some kind of <em>scheme</em>.
            </p>

        </div>

            <h3>email schemes</h3>
            <img src="images/email.png" alt="envelope" class="left" style="max-width: 15%; max-height:10%;">
            <p>

                Such schemes are probably already well known to most people
                already were in such an situation or heard stories from other
                people. For anybody who doesn't know the scheme thats described
                above here's a quick explanation. The suspect sends an <em>emotional
                e-mail</em> to victims, which e-mail addresses they got from
                some database, in this e-mail the is some story like an relative
                died and to inherit their belongings you should <em>pay a fee</em>. It could
                also be that there is an offer where you pay a fee and get
                money somehow but it could also "escalate" into a charity frauds
                through a heart warming story about a cancer patient or anything
                else like that.
            </p>

            <p>

                Most of these scammers probably just want to get some easy bucks
                from you but some are also out for personal information or
                credit card details
            </p>

            <h3>Pyramid Scheme</h3>

            <p>
                A pyramid scheme is more like a really sketchy company that
                tries to communicate to people that they can make easy money
                just by <em>paying a fee </em>and than promoting this "great" company
                with its unbelievable deals to get more people into signing in.
                A victim may actually get some kind of profit, but because the
                only thing the company does is <em>hiring people</em> for a fee and get
                them to sign even more people into this rabbit hole. So the only
                <em>income is the fee </em>everybody has to pay.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you may already thought the income the employees get are the
                fees of the victims below. Because of this model you always need
                to <em>get more subjects</em> into this mess to get money for the other
                poor souls who signed into this. The only person who makes a proper
                profit is the person who started the whole thing. Most of the time
                he will just get out of the company with all the earnings and
                the victims who probably didn't have much money before have just
                invested into one of the most unethical ways to make some quick cash.
            </p>

            <p>
                The legal situation about this scheme is quite weird, because if
                you get people invest their money into this scheme it's illegal,
                but if you get people to buy a product as the fee it's legal in most
                countries. This product is practically something that can be produced
                or bought dirt cheap

            <h3>Tech support</h3>

            <img src="images/TreeCommand.png" alt="tree command with a message" 
                 class="right" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 35%;">
            <p>
                This kind of scheme is own where a <em>supposed techsupport employee</em>
                that tries to get its victims <em>money, data or just to put on some malware</em>.
                Such an operation can be achieved in many ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common method is to get some users through <em>sketchy ads</em>
                on some websites to call a well known company(of course its their number),
                because the user is infected with some kind of malware. This
                <em>websites</em> are most of the time <em>bootleg copies</em>
                of the official website, but the domain needs to be different so
                you watch out for this. If you phone them they will probably try
                to <em>sell you some overpriced product</em> for an nonexistent
                thread. This software could also be some kind of malware.
            </p>

            <p>
                To <em>convince</em> you that you are indeed hacked by somebody, they
                interpret the <em>netstat</em> command wrong or just <em>type in a message</em>
                while a <em>tree</em> command is running. They often use screen sharing
                software like team viewer for this.
