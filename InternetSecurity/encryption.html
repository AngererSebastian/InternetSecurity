	<h3>Encryption</h3>
	<p>
		To ensure Security there a many different types of message encryption.
		Ones with just one key, also called <em>symmentrical</em> encryption and ones with
		key pairs where one encrypts and the other decrypts. They all have their uses
		but we will focus on the dual key system. The specific method we use for this
		page and our communication platform is called RSA. While we are sure our
		implementation <em>is not secure</em>, we think it is fine because our goals
		with this site are just educational ones.
        </p>

	<p>
		This part of our webpage will just focus on how to generate the RSA keys.
		If you want how something is encrypted or decrypted see our web app under
		<a href="app.html">here</a>.
		But if you're interested in encryption we recommend to read through this site first.

		<h3>Generate Key Parts</h3>

		<p>
			The first part to generate a key pair is to generate <em>two</em>
			preferably high <em>non identical prime numbers</em>, two make for a better demonstration
			you will need to input two prime numbers (q and p) which can't be the same number.
			To make calculations fast we recommend a range around 1 - 255 per prime.
			(If you need to implement this somewhere seriously, you probably should
			refer <em>other sources</em> and the generated number should of course be higher)
		</p>
		<label>Q: </label>
		<input type="text" id="Q" placeholder="Unique Prime"> <br>
		<label>P: </label>
		<input type="text" id="P" placeholder="Unique Prime"> <br>

	<script>
		function generateKeysAndSwitch () {
			const q = bigInt(document.getElementById('Q').value);
			const p = bigInt(document.getElementById('P').value);
			generateWithShow( q, p);
			switchView('getValues', 'getKeys');
		}

		<h3>Generate Keys</h3>
		<p>
			The next step is to calculate the basic components of the
			key calculation process. The first thing is to calculate the
			product of the two primes, which is also the second part of 
			each key
		</p>

		<section>
			<div id="oQ"></div> * <div id="oP"></div> = <div id="oProduct"></div>
		</section>

		<p>
			The next important value we need to find is the product of the phi
			function of the product. The phi function says how many <em>coprimes</em> are below
			that number. If the Argument is a prime the output will the prime number minus one.
			Also the phi function of an product is the same as the phi functions of the factors.
			So our calculation will be:
		</p>

		<section>
			&phi; = (<div id="oQ2"></div> - 1) * (<div id="oP2"></div> - 1) = <div id="oPhi"></div>
		</section>

		<p>
			With these values we can now calculate keys. First we need the first part of the
			<em>public key</em>, which is used to encrypt messages (the second part is the product). This key has two criteria it
			needs to accomplish. First it needs to be <em>smaller than &phi;</em> and it needs
			to be coprime with &phi; and the product, that means these two numbers aren't allowed to share any
			factors. The candidates for the public key are:
		</p>

		<section>
			<div id="lockCandidates"></div><br>
			We use the value <em><div id="oLock"></div></em> for further calculations
		</section>

		<p>
			The last part of the key generation is the private key (which is used to decrypt
			messages). The private key is defined as <em>private * public % &phi; = 1</em>.
			The % is the <em>modulo</em> operator and returns the remainder of a division.
			To solve this equation we need to calculate the mod inverse of the public key and
			phi (if you want to know how just search the web for an algorithm, but most of them
			look quite messy), if you don't want to use the mod inverse, you could just bruteforce
			and try any number until one gives the right answer.

		<h3>Encryption</h3>
		<p>
			The basics to encrypt a message is to get a number from it, we won't cover that here
		and then plug it into a simple formula
		</p>
		<section>
			Encryption : m ^ e % product <br>
			Decryption : c ^ d % product <br> <br>
			<em>m</em> : Message <br>
			<em>c</em> : Cipher (encrypted message) <br>
			<em>e</em> : public key <br>
			<em>d</em> : private
