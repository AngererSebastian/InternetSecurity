                 Unintentional harm is called software bug. <br>

                <h3>WORM</h3>
                <p> 
                    A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates
                     itself in order to spread to other computers.
                     Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself.
                     Worms almost always <em>cause some damage to the network</em>,
                     even if only by consuming bandwidth, but Viruses most
                     often corrupt files on a targeted computer.

                    <p>
                        Trojan is any malware which deceives the user of its true
                         intent. The name comes from the trojan horse which also
                         carried a malicious payload. They most often way is by
                         an email.Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.

                <h3>RANSOMWARE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology
                         that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually
                         block access to it, unless a ransom is paid. The first time
                         it occurred was <em>1989</em>, were a infected disc encrypted the 
                         data on it. After that the virus said that the license key
                         was expired and named the company where you can buy one.
                         Until then you were not able to use the disc anymore.

                    <p>
                        The fraud software is often embedded in free software.
                         The thieve shows a lot of useless pop-ups and asks
                         he user to pay if he wants the adfree version. After
                         the adware was introduced it is able to do all unwanted
                         actions. The <em>personal information</em> they gather
                         from you will later be sold to companies. Often other
                         applications will be affected.

                <h3>VIRUS</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            A computer virus is a type of computer program, which 
                             effects other computer programs by inserting its own code.
                             There are a lot of examples where talented hackers hacked
                             a system only too show that the network was vulnerable.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Often the virus is used as a payload for other
                             kinds of malware, but the real deal of a virus is that
                             they replicate themselves. The first known virus was the
                             "creeper" virus. It was an experiment form Bob Thomas.
                             Since then the virus was a hot topic in the computer world.
                             In 1987 Fred Cohen showed that there is no algorithm which
                             could detect all possible viruses. Later there were
                             discovered some useful functions.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Viruses always have a search routine, with which
                             they locates there next target. If the target
                             was found the next step is to copy it self into
                             the program.

                            <p>
                                <h4>Trigger</h4>
                                <p>
                                    It determines the condition under witch the "payload"
                                     will be activated. That could be for example particular
                                     date or a particular action.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Payload</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The "payload" is the actual body or data that performs
                                     the actual malicious purpose of the virus. Payload activity
                                     might be noticeable, as most of the time the "payload"
                                     itself is the harmful activity, or some times non-destructive
                                     but distributive, which is called Virus hoax.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Phases</h4>
                                <p>
                                    There are four different phases of a virus:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Dormant phase</li>
                                        The virus program waits for a certain trigger, to start it.
                                        <li>Propagation phase</li>
                                        The virus starts to replicate itself. It places a copy in a
                                         other program or in a certain area system area. 
                                        <li>Triggering phase</li>
                                        A dormant virus moves into this phase when it is activated.
                                         It waits for a certain condition that makes the virus stop.
                                         One of those could be for example a certain number of copies.
                                        <li>Execution phase</li>
                                        In this phase the virus releases its payload. It can be
                                         destructive such as deleting files on disk but it can also
                                         be something harmless like popping up political messages on screen.
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                            </p>
