Encryption

Project Information

We want to send encrypted file over a server to another client with public and private keys. 

Our timelimit is till the end of our semester.

This project will be prepared by Detta and Angerer.

Other contacts are: Professor Klewein and Professor Reder

Project Summary

We want to create our own way to send data. 

We will setup a server which can receive and send files to a other logged in client. It has a database, which  stores the logins, so you can log in. We want encrypt the data. 

Ther server has a queue with all of the operations. The server executes allways the first operation. If a client sends something the request will be added to the queue. This queue will be a json. 

Alessandro Detta and Sebastian Angerer will be working on this project.

It will probably take till the end of semester.
